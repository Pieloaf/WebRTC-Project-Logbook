## Introduction

This log book is going to document my research and work done in creating a video conferencing system using the WebRTC API and a JS framework for the front-end.\
This will be achieved by using the [RTCMultiConnection](https://github.com/muaz-khan/RTCMultiConnection) library for WebRTC API intereaction and to build a GUI on top of. STUN and TURN servers will then be added to support the WebRTC connection behind NATs and firewalls.

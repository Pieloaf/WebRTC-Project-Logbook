After discussing the Turn Server with my supervisor on Tuesday, I found that a monogDB database was not required to run the turn server and so I was able to go ahead and set up the Turn server on my webserver. While doing so I found that using the docker image may not be the best way to do so, although it enables portability and flexibilty, opening a large number of ports with docker was reported to have some issues. I ran the Turn server using the compiled binary instead. I was unable to test it though as I did not have multiple networks behind firewalls to be able to do so.

Today I spent time working on being the media controls being left behind when a peer disconnected. This turned out to be quite straight forward after some research. The issue was due to an unclean removal of the video element. The stream to be removed was not being stopped before removing the video element. This was fixed by listening for the leave event and calling media stream stop function before removing the video element.

One issue i was initially having when testing the site on a mobile device (an iPhone using Safari) was remote streams were getting added twice to the chat and when a user would disconnect the video controls for the stream would be left behind. I spent some time today degbugging this. Without a MacOS machine I couldn't use inspector on the mobile version and so was required to debug it by sending alerts through the browser. I found a work around to the double streams by checking the userid for the onstream event to see if the userid was already linked to a stream. If so I was able to just return from the event handler without adding a duplicate stream. However, I'm still unsure as to why there were two onstream events triggered for the same event on mobile but not on desktop as the code for both was identical.

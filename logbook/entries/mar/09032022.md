I spent most of my time on the project for the last week contemplating an appropriate approach to take to scaling the videos. Initally I was trying to figure out how to calculate the the grid divisions in such a way to best maintain the original aspect ratio of the video streams, however I later noticed that most video conferecning platforms dont maintain aspect ratio at all, they seem to dived the space into a square as best possible and then scale the video to fill the space, while also offering an option to zoom out and maintain the aspect ratio.

Realising this I'm able to focus on the next part of the problem which is when to add a new column or row to the grid.

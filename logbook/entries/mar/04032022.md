I started working on the GUI again today. As vanilla CSS was proving not to be enough to be able to make the responsive video grid, I spent some time reviewing how meet.jit.si handle responsiveness through looking at the web inspector and the first thing I noticed was the width and height of the videos was being set explicitly through JS. I then cloned the meet.jit.si github repo to have a look at how the JS handles the responsiveness how ever the volume of code was more than I was expeciting and after some searching I left it alone and decided to try design my own approach to it.

Today I spent most of my time working on moving from flexbox to grid as mentioned in [Log 17](12032022.md). The method described there was implemented quite easily and worked well with the only issue being that the if the bottom number of screens did not fill the width, they were aligned to the left. I looked into centering the streams breifly and it can be achieved although the css gets quite messy and would involve more JS as the number over rows is changing dynamically and so I'd rather not have to deal with all that and its only a minor visual difference so I've decided just to move on with the grid as it is.

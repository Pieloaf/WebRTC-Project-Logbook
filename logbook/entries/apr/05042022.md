During a final meeting with my supervisor today, when showing the current state of the application, there was an issue with stream cropping which I had not experienced on my desktop, however he was happy with the rest of the progress on it. The goal for the Easter break is to finish on the majority of the code to allow the remainder of the time to work on the report. After the meeting I spent some time looking into the cropping issue which was fixed quite easily by setting the max-width for the container. I recorded a video of the working fix and sent it to my supervisor for review.

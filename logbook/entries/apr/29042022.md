After the frustration the last day with the file sharing, today I moved on to muting streams, the base functionality here was relatively straight forward as the library has functions and call back handlers for it. Making it look nice was a bit trickier, I wanted to put in a placeholder image if a camera is disabled but I ran into some issues when triggering this depending on if my mic was muted when muting or unmuting my camera, I tried a few different checks in the mute and unmute functions but was still giving me some problems. I'll take another look at it tomorrow.

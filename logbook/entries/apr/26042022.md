Today was my first meeting with my supervisor after the Easter break. I showed him the current state of the project with the chat and grid in React now. However it wasn't as much work done as we had hoped for. I explained about the trouble I had in the first week and ended up losing a lot of time there getting the grid to work in React. File sharing, stream muting and screen recording still need to be done as well as starting the report. For next week I hope to have file sharing and stream muting finished.

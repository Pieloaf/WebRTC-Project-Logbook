Today I went back to working on the muting and unmuting after the issues with it yesterday. Coming back to it today, I realised I could store the camera and microphone states in state variables, and this can be checked then to determine what to do. I also found an issue where if someone joins while someone else has muted their camera it is displayed again. I found a work around for this by just adding a muted state to the extra data section which is sent to peers on a connection. I just set up the code to check this mute state before adding the stream.

Today I started working on the chat, I decided to take the same approach as with the grid by working on it in isolation, so I've just continued using the test application I used to build the responsive grid. The chat was quite straight forward it was mostly styling once and event listener was set up to handle messages. I just made each message a styled span, I don't see much need for a full react component for a message object. I suppose it might make embedding links or images in chat easier, but that's not within the scope of the project.

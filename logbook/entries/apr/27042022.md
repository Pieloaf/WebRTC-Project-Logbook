Today I started to look at file sharing, RTCMultiConnection does have support for it within the library so I had hoped it wouldn't take too long, I followed the documentation enabling file sharing and calling send with a file argument, but nothing seemed to happen on the local client or remote peer. I spent a sometime looking into it and trying different file handling functions in the library and console logging on the event firing etc. to see if I could find out how far it was getting before the function failed, but couldn't get much from it. I also had a short look to see if it could be done without the library like converting the file to a blob and sending the blob URL to the receiver to unpack, but I've decided not to go too deep into it for now since there's other aspects of the project unfinished but will come back to this later if there's time.

After some more work on migrating the code to react, I have gotten as far as making a request to the websocket server. I initially set my React dev server to point to localhost:9001 for the websokcet server which is where the preconfigured demo server in the RTCMultiConnection library is listening, however I was getting CORS error as I was using ssl on the http server but not on the react server. Next, I built the production version of the react app and placed it in the demos folder, however now I was getting routing errors and the JavaScript content was not being loaded.

Using Rob Masons "Getting Started with WebRTC" as a reference, I plan to re-implement a signalling server using [express.js](https://expressjs.com) which I can also use to host to the built react app with correct rendering and routing.

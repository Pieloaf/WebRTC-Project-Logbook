Today with my supervisor after discussing report progress I showed him the screen sharing but also pointed out the issues with it. He told me though, that screen sharing was not necessary it was a bonus the focus should be screen recording, but was a nice addition. So for now I've decided to remove the tool bar icon for it assuming I won't have time to add it. I then started on screen recording. The library also includes a recordRTC feature with a few different approaches and methods to upload the stream to a server for sharing via a link, but with how close the deadline is I decided to just record and save locally because uploading to the server would require more server code for handling POST requests and file storage space on the server. Something I don't quite like about the way I've implemented it is that the user is required to select the window/tab/screen to record which is not so seamless. It seems like other services capture each of the individual streams on the server and then compile it to single video with something like FFmpeg, without that the only alternative is creating a html canvas and recording that, but I'm not sure that will work with video elements and it also means copying each frame to the canvas on every single video frame which would be quite resource intensive so I've just decided to stick with what I have.

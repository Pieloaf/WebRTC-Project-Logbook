I met with my supervisor again today regarding report progress but I also asked if I could get some lab time before the deadline to do a sort of "official" final test case for recording results for the report, so we'll be meeting on Thursday after my last exam to do that. In the mean time I've decided to give screen share another attempt. I took a different approach and basically parse through all connected peers and for each peer replace the track with the screen track. Although there's no way to revert back yet, and it also doesn't display on the client. But I've left it for now as I need to prepare for my last exam.

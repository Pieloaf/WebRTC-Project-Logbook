After spending the last week or so working on the report today I decided to work on screen sharing and which I was able to get it working for the local machine and any peers to join after the screen share had started, but already connected peers don't see the screen. I will need to try a different approach to this later because simply adding a new stream isn't triggering the on stream handler on connected peers.

I spent some time looking into getting HTTPS working with the react development server and found that it can be done creating an environemtn file in the root of the project, and specific HTTPS to be true and point to the certificate and key files to be used. This has now really helped with development speed.

Since the main functionality was now in place I decieded to work an intermediary room when a user initially joins a call to allow them to select their camera and audio device to be used when they join. I got quite disctracted however looking into the details of the webrtc and getusermedia apis rather than working on the funcitonalty of the site and so didnt get as far as I wanted with it.

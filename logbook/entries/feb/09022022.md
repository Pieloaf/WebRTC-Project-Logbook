I started work on the room page by creating the autohiding toolbar at the bottom of the page. I didnt add any functionality to the buttons, only created a shell for them with placeholder icons. One complication with the tool bar is the responsive aspect of it. As the screen gets smaller the excess icons should be stacked in a sub menu rather than wrapping or shrinking. This hasn't been implemented yet, however I think I will approach it using an event listener for a page resize, and adjust the toolbar accordingly. I also set out a blank area for the chat at the side and space for the video grid.

Front end development was starting to feel quite repetive, even switching between different aspects of it, and so I decided to take a look at setting up a TURN server on my webserver using coturn, the TURN Server project. I spent some time reading through the documentation for it and also docker, and began setting up the server. One thing I was unsure of was whether or not a database would be required for storing authentication details for a user. The turn project allows database connections for storing credentials. Refering to the Debian [man pages](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/coturn/coturn.1.en.html#WEBRTC_USAGE) for coturn and looking at the webrtc section, webRTC uses long-term auth with a TURN server and so setting up of a username and password is required. This could be done through a database or file and require authentication, however this would mean that anonymous users would not be able to use the service unlike meet.jit.si. To cicumvent this a hardcoded username and password can be used in the client to be supplied to the Turn server. Before getting the TURN server running I decided to wait for the meeting with my supervisor on Tuesday to discuss the purpose of using a database for the turn server.

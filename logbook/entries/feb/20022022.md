I continued to work some more on the opening page and got a bit further but once again spent a lot time looking a the apis and testing different parts. One thing I noticed was that calling the `stop()` function on a stream meant that the stream had to be completely removed and recreated to be enabled again. There is also an enabled property to each stream object, however setting that to false does not disabled the stream, it is just not used while the mic or camera led indicator remain active. I think the best approach to disabling a video stream or mic temporarily as set by a user is to use the `stop()` function and just restart the stream when requested.

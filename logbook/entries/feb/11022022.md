I began considering how to implement the responsive video grid. There are a number of aspects to consider with the video grid, the first is that the space for each video needs to scale respective to the size of the window but also with respect to the amount of videos on the screen. I initally began with flexbox to control the layout however there was issue with deciding when to reduce the width of a video or break onto a new line. Although it might seem like maintiaining aspect ratio is important, many video conferencing applications adjust the aspect ratio to fit more streams on screen.
